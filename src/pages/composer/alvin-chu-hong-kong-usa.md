programmeNotes: >-
  “And the scent of orchid musk lingers still,


  The Sound of hangings pendants moves slowly away.


  The eastern wind sways, then drags up, strands of weeping willows,


  Floating threads catch and stir up petals of peach blossom;


  The pearly curtains now hide, now show, her lotus face.


  You say she is of the family of His Excellency, executive of Hezhong Prefecture;


  I say she is an apparition of Guanyin, contemplating moonlight in water.”
