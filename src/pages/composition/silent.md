  Reflecting on silence as a response in the face of discrimination and
  oppression, the chamber quartet Charsu is collaborating with composer Parisa
  Sabet and visual artist Rah Eleh in a new media-music-performance workshop
  project. Featuring vocal contemporary music and dancing with digital imagery
  inspired by the poem Wind-Up Doll by Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad (1934 â€“
  1967), a controversial modernist and iconoclast.


  The poem is generally interpreted as an icon of feminist poetry by Iranians. Now, more than ever, we need to stand in solidarity with the women and people of Iran who want a fair and just future with freedom of choice. We must not remain silent in the face of oppression and challenge the status quo.


  Charsu (translated as "Four Directions" in Farsi) is a quartet of classical contemporary that has a focus on the developments of new works, and the support of existing works by living composers, especially Iranian composers composing in diaspora.
