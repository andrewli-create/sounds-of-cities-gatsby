  “And the scent of orchid musk lingers still,<br>


  The Sound of hangings pendants moves slowly away.<br>


  The eastern wind sways, then drags up, strands of weeping willows,<br>


  Floating threads catch and stir up petals of peach blossom;<br>


  The pearly curtains now hide, now show, her lotus face.<br>


  You say she is of the family of His Excellency, executive of Hezhong Prefecture;<br>


  I say she is an apparition of Guanyin, contemplating moonlight in water.”<br>
