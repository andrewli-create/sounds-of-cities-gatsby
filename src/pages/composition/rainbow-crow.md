  After a long period of cold weather, the animals of the community become
  worried. They decide to send a messenger to the Great Sky Spirit to ask for
  relief.


  The Rainbow Crow, the most beautifully feathered bird, offers to make the arduous journey. It travels safely and is rewarded by the Great Spirit with the gift of fire. He carries the gift in his beak back to his people, but upon his return, he does not appear to be the same bird that he once was.


  The fire has scorched his plumage black, with only hints of his previous colour, and his voice has been made rough and hoarse by the smoke. In this way, his sacrifice is commemorated.
