programmeNotes: Subterranean Dreams is a piece of music which expresses a series
  of dreams that take place in underground cities. The work is written for the
  University of Toronto Percussion Ensemble, who I am lucky to be the composer
  in residence for in 2021-2022. It is dedicated to Ryan Taylor, a close friend
  of mine who introduced me to the art of percussion many years ago.
