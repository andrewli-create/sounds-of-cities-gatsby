programmeNotes: The film, ‘Kairos’ is a movie about making the right choice at
  the right moment. At the movie, the director,Jean Ho, was trying to discuss
  what is the suitable choice in different circumstances. As a film composer, my
  first job is find the unique tone for the movie while using music to letting
  audience to understand the storyline. For fulfilling those main two points, I
  tried to blend traditional western orchestral music and electronic elements to
  enhancing the sci-fi and heart-felt feeling.
